\subsection{Research scope}{This parallel version of tarjan’s algorithms is presented based on depth-first search, for three problems relevant to model checking: given a state graph, to find its strongly connected components, which states are in loops, and which states are in “lassos”. The algorithm typically exhibits about a four-fold speed-up over the corresponding sequential algorithms on an eight-core machine\cite{ref3}.}
